# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Travel Buddy

## Description
This is a travel app that requires your location permission. It displays the nearest real-time restaurants, hotels and other attractions around you using your geographical location coordinates. This information is dynamic, it changes as you change location.
## Installation
Run `npm start` on your terminal and open up [localhost:300](http://localhost:3000) on your browser and the project will open live.
## Usage
This app requires your location permission, once enabled, you would see the various **restaurants, hotels,** and **other attractions** available near you. This is made possible by the coordinates of your current location as provided by the Google Map API. 

You can click on each attraction on the map, and the full details would appear on the left bar (or top bar for mobile). In addition, you could search for any location or filter out some locations by category. 
## APIs 
Google Map API provides the location coordinates.
Travel Advisory API on RapidAPI provides the real-time restaurant, hotel and attractions data. 
## LIVE 
This project is paused for now as I have exceeded the number of API requests for the period.
